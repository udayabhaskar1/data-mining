Abstract:

The purpose of this report is to use different methods of preprocessing and data mining
techniques to gain an understanding of congressional voting patterns in the United states on
various set policies and agendas. The aim is to understand the accuracy and the timeliness of the
information in the chosen dataset, which is extremely important in future implementation of the
model.

After the dataset was chosen, it was checked for any errors or missing values. The data was then
cleaned using various preprocessing methods which included replacing the missing values.
Classification was then performed on the data using OneR, J48 and Naïve-Bayes algorithms to
find any interesting patterns. Separate tests were run with different parameters to check for the
highest accuracy rates of predicting the data. Visual tree structures were used in representing
data to make it easier for the user to understand it.

The results of the tests varied slightly. Even though, Naïve-Bayes had a lower accuracy rate as
compared to J48, the voting patterns were much more clear when this algorithm was used. The
J48 provided the highest accuracy rate in predicting the data.

The experiments performed were an excellent way of gaining an understanding of the data, as
well as learning the intricacies of the algorithms used. The result showed an interesting pattern
that can be extremely beneficial in using the same methods for a comparative study of similar
datasets. The congressional voting patterns can be easily compared by these methods and
changes in policy and agenda of the political parties can be identified.
